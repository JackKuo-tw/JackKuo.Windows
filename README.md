# What

This repo stores my configuration on Windows.

I've written a blog post "[Mac 用戶的 Windows 生存指南](https://jackkuo.org/post/windows_runbook_for_mac_users/)" to describe how can a macOS user survive on Windows.

## sim_mac.ahk

[AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) configuration to simulate mac shortcut.

In addition, I have simulate vim Up/Down/Left/Right by CapsLock + {hjkl}.

Because CapsLock key is useless if you get used to use `Shift` key to Captalize word, I set it to `ESC`.
